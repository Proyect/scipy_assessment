# Revelo's SWE Assessment - Log & Thoughts

This document details the process followed to complete the SciPy Assessment, focusing on fixing the environment, implementing a test using TDD principles for the `__round__` method on sparse matrices, and documenting the challenges encountered.

## 1. Objective

The primary goal was to write a unit test for the proposed `__round__` method for SciPy's sparse matrices (specifically CSR) following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. This involved setting up a working Docker environment, writing a failing test (Red), applying the provided code fix (patch), and verifying that the test passes (Green).

## 2. Environment Setup (Dockerfile Fixes)

The initial phase involved getting the provided `Dockerfile` to build successfully and create an environment where SciPy could be compiled from source and its tests could be run.

**Initial Problems Encountered:**

*   **Missing Build Dependencies:** The build failed due to missing essential system packages required for compiling C, C++, and Fortran code, as well as Python C headers and BLAS/LAPACK libraries.
*   **`apt-get` Issues:** The `apt-get install` commands were failing likely due to missing `apt-get update` or the `-y` flag for non-interactive confirmation.
*   **`sed` Command Quoting:** A `sed` command intended to modify `setup.py` failed due to incorrect quoting within the `RUN` instruction. Initially tried escaping double quotes (`\"`), which failed. Switching to single quotes (`'`) for the `sed` expression resolved this.
*   **`sed` File Not Found:** The `sed` command then failed with "No such file or directory" because the `COPY . .` instruction bringing the source code into the image was placed *after* the `sed` command attempting to modify it.
*   **SciPy Installation Failure (Silent):** Even after fixing the above, `import scipy` failed inside the container (`ModuleNotFoundError`). Rebuilding with `--no-cache` and inspecting verbose logs (`pip install ... -v`) revealed the installation from source was failing silently or incompletely.
*   **Metadata Generation Error (`msvccompiler`):** A key build failure during `pip install .` was `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils.msvccompiler'`. This occurred during the PEP 517 metadata preparation phase and seemed caused by `numpy.distutils` incorrectly trying to access Windows-specific compiler tools within the Linux container.

**Fixes Applied to Dockerfile:**

*   Added necessary packages to `apt-get install`: `build-essential`, `gfortran`, `python3-dev`, `libopenblas-dev`, `liblapack-dev` (later potentially simplified to just `libopenblas-dev`).
*   Ensured `apt-get update` runs before `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends` within the same `RUN` layer.
*   Corrected the `sed` command quoting using single quotes: `sed -i 's/...' setup.py`.
*   Reordered `WORKDIR`, `COPY . .`, and `RUN sed...` instructions to ensure source code was copied *before* being modified.
*   Re-introduced the `--no-use-pep517` flag during `pip install .` to bypass the PEP 517 metadata generation step that was causing the `msvccompiler` error, forcing the build to rely directly on `setup.py`.
*   **Crucially removed the `-e` (editable) flag** from `pip install --no-use-pep517 . -v`. This was vital to prevent runtime import errors and `pytest` path conflicts later.

After these fixes, the `docker build` completed successfully, installing SciPy from the local source code into the image's `site-packages`.

## 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

The core task involved writing a test for the `__round__` functionality.

**3.1. Test Implementation (`test_csr.py`)**

*   A new test class `TestRoundCSR(unittest.TestCase)` was added to `scipy/sparse/tests/test_csr.py`. Using `unittest.TestCase` allowed leveraging standard assertions like `assertIsInstance`.
*   The test method `test_round_csr` was created to:
    1.  Set up a sample `csr_matrix` with floating-point data.
    2.  Call `round(matrix)` and `round(matrix, 1)`.
    3.  Define the expected `csr_matrix` outputs with rounded data.
    4.  Assert that the results are instances of `csr_matrix`, have the correct shape, indices, and indptr, and that the `data` attribute contains the correctly rounded values (using `numpy.testing.assert_array_almost_equal`).
*   A `try...except TypeError` block was initially included around the `round()` calls to handle the expected error in the Red phase, allowing the test to proceed and fail later on `UnboundLocalError`.

**3.2. Red Phase: Executing the Test (Before Patch)**

*   **Challenge 1: Runtime Import Error:** Initial attempts to import `scipy` interactively or run tests from within the `/usr/src/app/scipy_assessment` directory failed with `ImportError: ... cannot import scipy while being in scipy source directory ...`.
    *   **Solution:** For interactive checks, changed directory (`cd /tmp`) before launching `python`. For running tests, this required a more robust approach.
*   **Challenge 2: Pytest Path Conflict:** Using `python -m unittest ...` from the project root still failed with the same `ImportError`. Switching to `pytest` initially resulted in `_pytest.pathlib.ImportPathMismatchError` regarding `conftest.py`. This was diagnosed as a conflict between the source directory and the installed package, likely exacerbated by the (now removed) editable install.
    *   **Solution:** Executing `pytest` from a neutral directory (`/tmp`) using the `--pyargs` flag to specify the test module (`pytest --pyargs scipy.sparse.tests.test_csr -k test_round_csr -v`) successfully isolated the test execution to use the *installed* version of SciPy, avoiding the path conflicts.
*   **Expected Failure:** With the correct execution command, the test failed as expected with `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'rounded_A_0' referenced before assignment`. This confirmed the Red phase: the test correctly identified the problem (the underlying `TypeError` from `round()` prevented result variables from being assigned).

**3.3. Patch Application**

*   **Challenge:** Applying the provided `fix.patch` using `git apply fix.patch` repeatedly failed with `error: corrupt patch at line 7`, even after attempting `git checkout -- <files>` and using `--ignore-space-change --ignore-whitespace`. This likely indicated subtle line ending or whitespace inconsistencies between the patch file and the local source files that Git couldn't reconcile.
    *   **Solution:** The patch was **applied manually** by editing `scipy/sparse/base.py` and `scipy/sparse/data.py` directly, carefully adding the `__round__` methods as specified in the patch file.

**3.4. Rebuilding the Image (Crucial Step)**

*   It was identified that simply applying the patch (manually) to the source code in the mounted volume was **not sufficient**. The version of SciPy being tested by `pytest --pyargs` was the one *installed in the Docker image's `site-packages` during the build*.
*   **Solution:** The Docker image was **rebuilt** using `docker build -t scipy_test_env .` *after* the patch was applied manually to the source code. This ensured the `pip install --no-use-pep517 . -v` step during the build compiled and installed the *patched* version of SciPy.

**3.5. Green Phase: Executing the Test (After Patch and Rebuild)**

*   A new container was started from the rebuilt image.
*   The same command (`cd /tmp && pytest --pyargs scipy.sparse.tests.test_csr -k test_round_csr -v`) was executed.
*   The test now **PASSED** (`[100%] OK`), confirming that the `__round__` method implemented by the patch correctly provided the rounding functionality and satisfied the test assertions.

## 4. Challenges & Learnings

*   **Environment Complexity:** Setting up the build environment for SciPy requires careful attention to system dependencies. Docker helps reproducibility but requires debugging the `Dockerfile`.
*   **Python Import Paths & Testing:** Running tests for an installed package while being inside its source directory is tricky. Editable installs can exacerbate this. Using `pytest --pyargs` from a neutral directory proved effective.
*   **TDD Cycle:** The process reinforced the TDD methodology â€“ ensuring a test fails for the right reason before making it pass.
*   **Patch Application Issues:** `git apply` can be sensitive to subtle file differences (like line endings). Manual application is a fallback, but understanding *why* it failed is important.
*   **Docker Build vs. Runtime:** Changes made to mounted volumes *after* a build do not affect packages installed *during* the build. Rebuilding the image is necessary to incorporate source code changes into the installed package.

## 5. Final Output

The `assessment.patch` file was generated using `git diff --patch HEAD . > assessment.patch`, containing all modifications to the `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, the new test in `test_csr.py`, and the manually applied code changes to `base.py` and `data.py`.
